															<p>When a million refugees showed up in Europe this past year, the world began to take notice of a problem
																that has been steadily growing before our eyes. Ten years ago, 38 million people had been driven from their homes
																 because of war or persecution; right now that number stands at over 65 million.
																  That’s equivalent to the population of France … drifting
																, stranded, with little hope of returning home, and few chances to thrive in neighboring countries.</p>

															<p>
We usually imagine migrant workers as young men who travel abroad to find jobs
in agriculture, construction or restaurants. Less attention is paid to women,
 who also migrate; we tend to think of them as passively accompanying their husbands.
 In fact, more than half of the Latin American migrants to the U.S. are women
 searching for jobs as domestics or in light manufacturing such as garment or microelectronic factories..</p>

															<p>The impacts and implications of the COVID-19 coronavirus are different
																for men and women and may create greater inequalities for people who are
																in vulnerable positions, such as migrants, according to UN Women.
Organizations around the world are aware of this inequality and have warned about the urgent
 need to look at existing realities from gender and intersectional perspectives that allow for
  the identification of these inequalities and, at the same time,
incorporate greater protection and assistance to more vulnerable populations in response plans.</p>

															Putting the Spotlight on Women Migrant Workers</a></h3>
														<p>The pros and cons. Mostly cons.</p>
													</header>
													<p>As labour markets shuffle in the new world order, two distinct patterns have emerged.
														 Women have increasingly moved to hospitality and nursing industries, or the “domestic” economy,
														  as well as areas previously dominated by men, such as agriculture.
														 Demand has continued to rise in developed countries, but women’s contributions have
														  been severely under-appreciated.</p>
													<p>This is why, experts from UN Women and the United Nations University
														(UNU) in New York came together this week to discuss and raise awareness
														about migrant women workers’ rights.In 2015, female migrant workers,
														who number 117 million, contributed about half of the world’s total remittance flow.</p>
